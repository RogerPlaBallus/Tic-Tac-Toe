Play the Tic Tac Toe Game (3 en ralla). How does it work?

![tictactoe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5be1b077-0da1-402b-b92d-bd2590123b20)

  1. There are two players, X and O. X starts and for each click the player changes from one to the other.
  2. Each time a player wins one point gets assigned to the winning player. If there is a draw no one gets a point.
  3. Reset the game with the Reset button.
  4. Invite your family and friends and play against each other or by yourself.
